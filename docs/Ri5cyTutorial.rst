Ri5cy Tutorial
--------------

Ri5cy is a 32-bit RISC-V implementation developed as part of the PULP platform.
It supports the IMFC set of standard RISC-V extensions and is available under
the Solderpad hardware license (version 0.51).

Because the Embecosm Debug Server source itself doesn't contain any
usable targets, the Ri5cy target exists to serve as a basic target
which is immediately useful for users, and a template for implementors
to follow when implementing their own targets.

The Ri5cy target is an example of a baremetal target which targets a
``verilator``-generated cycle accurate simulation.

This tutorial covers the following areas:

- Building a baremetal RISC-V tool chain that can target and debug Ri5cy.
- Building and running the Ri5cy target for the debug server
- The structure of the Ri5cy target.
